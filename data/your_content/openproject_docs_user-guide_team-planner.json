You can use it to track the current progress of work packages your team is working on, schedule new tasks, reschedule them or even reassign them to different members. Essentially, the team planner is a calendar view with an assignee column on the left side. Each work package assigned to a team member will appear as a card that spans a certain duration (start date to finish date). These cards can be moved, stretched, shortened or removed to organize the planning of your team. To use this module, you must have the work packages module enabled. Your browser does not support the video tag. Module overview Clicking on the Team planners entry on the left sidebar takes you to the team planner module with a list of all existing team planners: You can create a new team planner using either the + Team planner button in the top right near your avatar or at the bottom of the left menu bar. Click on an existing (saved) team planner to open it. Team planners marked as favorite under visibility settings appear under the Favorite heading in the menu bar. Team planners with public visibility settings appear under the Public heading in the menu bar. New team planners by default appear under the Private heading in the left menu bar. These are visible only to you. Tip Both public and private team planners can be added as favorited planners.
