Discover OpenProject's strategic roadmap Just like our source code, we are making the development roadmap transparent to the public. It shows all topics that we have recently released, are currently working on, and are planning for the future. The roadmap is automatically generated and is updated regularly from our Community instance, where you will find more details to all topics on the roadmap. Please note that the timeline and feature set are subject to change as we continue to develop OpenProject. Our open source philosophy drives this process, and we strive to remain open and transparent throughout the journey.
