This guide details how to contribute to OpenProject. Get in touch Please get in touch with us using our development forum or send us an email to info@openproject.org. Issue tracking and coordination We eat our own ice cream so we use OpenProject for roadmap planning and team collaboration. Please have a look at the following pages: Development roadmap Development roadmap Wish list Wish list Bug backlog Bug backlog Reporting a bug Reporting a bug Submit a feature idea Submit a feature idea Development Environment Take a look at the bottom under Additional resources to see how to setup your development environment. Highlighting Development Environment To make it easier to distinguish a development instance, it is using a tinted website icon and modified app header. This behavior can be disabled by setting an environment variable OPENPROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_HIGHLIGHT_ENABLED=false (see also documentation on configuration). Branching model and development flow Please see this separate guide for the git branching model and core development. Development concepts We prepared a set of documentation concepts for an introduction into various backend and frontend related topics of OpenProject. Please see the concepts main page for more. Translations If you want to contribute to the localization of OpenProject and its plugins you can do so on the Crowdin OpenProject page. Once a day we fetch those locales and automatically upload them to GitHub. Contributing there will ensure your language will be up to date for the next release! More on this topic can be found in our blog post. Packaging process Please see this separate guide for the process of building packages of OpenProject. Testing Please add tests to your code to verify functionality, especially if it is a new feature. Pull requests will be verified by TravisCI as well, but please run them locally as well and make sure they are green before creating your pull request. We have a lot of pull requests coming in and it takes some time to run the complete suite for each one. If you push to your branch in quick succession, please consider stopping the associated Travis builds, as Travis will run for each commit. This is especially true if you force push to the branch. Please also use [ci skip] in your commit message to suppress builds which are not necessary (e.g. after fixing a typo in the README). Inactive pull requests We want to keep the Pull request list as cleaned up as possible - we will aim close pull requests after an inactivity period of 30 days (no comments, no further pushes) which are not labeled as work in progress by us. Security If you notice a security issue in OpenProject, please send us a GPG encrypted email to security@openproject.com and describe the issue you found. Download our public GPG key BDCF E01E DE84 EA19 9AE1 72CE 7D66 9C6D 4753 3958 here. Please include a description on how to reproduce the issue if possible. Our security team will get your email and will attempt to reproduce and fix the issue as soon as possible.
