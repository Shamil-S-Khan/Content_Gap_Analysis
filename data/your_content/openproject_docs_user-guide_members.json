Project members overview On the left side menu you will see Members. When selected, it will show a list of project members, project groups, as well as the users with whom work packages from this project have been shared. You can edit or delete a user or a group by clicking the respective icon at the end of the line listing the user or group. Standard filters on the left side menu include the following: All - returns all members and groups of the project, as well as non-members, with whom one or more work packages from this project have been shared All - returns all members and groups of the project, as well as non-members, with whom one or more work packages from this project have been shared Locked - returns all locked users that are members of this project, as well as locked non-members, with whom one or more work packages from this project have been shared Locked - returns all locked users that are members of this project, as well as locked non-members, with whom one or more work packages from this project have been shared Invited - returns all users that have been invited, but have not yet registered Invited - returns all users that have been invited, but have not yet registered Project roles provides filters based on all the member roles that have been assigned to users in that specific project. Project roles provides filters based on all the member roles that have been assigned to users in that specific project. Work package shares provides filters based on all the roles available for sharing work packages. They include:   All shares - returns all users that a work package in this project has been shared with   View - returns all users that can view, but not edit or comment on a work package that has been shared with them   Comment - returns all users that are allowed to add comments to a work package that has been shared with them   Edit - returns all users that are permitted to edit a work package that has been shared with them Work package shares provides filters based on all the roles available for sharing work packages. They include: All shares - returns all users that a work package in this project has been shared with All shares - returns all users that a work package in this project has been shared with View - returns all users that can view, but not edit or comment on a work package that has been shared with them View - returns all users that can view, but not edit or comment on a work package that has been shared with them Comment - returns all users that are allowed to add comments to a work package that has been shared with them Comment - returns all users that are allowed to add comments to a work package that has been shared with them Edit - returns all users that are permitted to edit a work package that has been shared with them Edit - returns all users that are permitted to edit a work package that has been shared with them Note: users, with whom work packages from a given project have been shared, can not be edited or deleted under Members. To edit or revoke their viewing rights you can click on the âNumber of work package(s) in the column âSharedâ (3 work packages in the example above). This will open an already filtered work package list of all work packages shared with that user. Another way is to navigate to Work packages, select the Shared with users filter and adjust the privileges accordingly. Read more here. Groups lists all the groups that have been added to this project (this filter will only be visible if a group has been added to the project). Note: members that are part of a group will also be displayed as members individually. In that case you can only edit the roles assigned to the users, but not delete him or her. If you want to delete a user that is a member of a group (also added to this project) you will have to delete the entire group and add group members individually if needed. You can adjust the displayed members by clicking on the filter icon in the top right corner next to + Member button. Once you are done adjusting your preferences, click the green Apply button. You can adjust the project member overview based on following filters: Status - allows filtering based on the user status, such as active, invited, locked or registered. Group - allows filtering for project members that are part of an existing group (all groups available in your instance will be listed as options), even if the group itself has not been added to the project. Role - allows filtering based on all the user roles that have been assigned to users in that specific project. The options of this filters are the same as in the left side menu.
