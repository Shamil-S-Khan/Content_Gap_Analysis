  "content": "On this page   Overview Overview Work packages Work packages are items in a project (such as tasks, features, risks, user stories, bugs, change requests). A work package captures important information and can be assigned to project members for execution. Work packages have a type, an ID, a subject and may have various additional attributes, such as status, assignee, priority, due date. Work package ID is defined as a unique integer assigned to a newly created work package. Work package IDs cannot be changed and are numbered across all projects of an OpenProject instance (therefore, the numbering within a project may not be sequential). Types are the different items a work package can represent, such as task, feature, bug, phase, milestone. The work package types can be configured in the system administration. Work packages can be displayed in a projects timeline, e.g. as a milestone or a phase. In order to use the work packages, the work package module has to be activated in the project settings.
