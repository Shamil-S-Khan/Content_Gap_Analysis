Every change to the OpenProject code base ends up in an open repository accessible to everyone. This results in a transparent software where every commit can be traced back to the contributor. Automated tests and manual code reviews ensure that these contributions are safe for the entire community of OpenProject. These tests encompass the correctness of security and access control features. We have ongoing collaborations with security professionals from to test the OpenProject code base for security exploits. For more information on security and data privacy for OpenProject, please visit: www.openproject.org/security-and-privacy. security.txt OpenProject uses the security.txt standard for defining security policies. You can find our security.txt here: www.openproject.org/security.txt Please see securitytxt.org for more information. Security announcements mailing list If you want to receive immediate security notifications via email as we publish them, please sign up to our security mailing list. No messages except for security advisories or security related announcements will be sent there. To unsubscribe, you will find a link at the end of every email. Any security related information will also be published on our blog and in the release notes. Security advisory list OpenProject uses GitHub to manage and publish security advisory listings Security vulnerability processing When we receive vulnerability reports from researchers or through internal identification, the following process is taking place immediately: A security vulnerability is reported internally or through security@openproject.com (see below on how to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly). A security engineer is receiving and validating the report. An internal tracking ticket is created with a checklist template on how to process the report. The reporter receives a timely response with an acknowledgement of the report, further questions if present, and an estimated timeline and complexity of a potential fix. The security engineer coordinates with the security and development team to prepare and test a fix for the report. A GitHub advisory draft is created and a CVE is requested, if appropriate. Security researchers are invited to collaborate on the draft, if available. A patch is returned to the reporter and awaited for confirmation unless fix is trivial A patch release is created, published and distributed for all supported installations The security vulnerability is publicly disclosed on GitHub and communicated through the mailing list Reporting a vulnerability We take all facets of security seriously at OpenProject. If you want to report a security concerns, have remarks, or contributions regarding security at OpenProject, please reach out to us at security@openproject.com. If you can, please send us a PGP-encrypted email using the following key: Key ID: 0x7D669C6D47533958, Fingerprint BDCF E01E DE84 EA19 9AE1 72CE 7D66 9C6D 4753 3958 You may also find the key attached in our OpenProject repository. You can also report a vulnerability directly in GitHub, if you prefer. In that case, please also send an informal email to security@openproject.com with the link to the advisory, as GitHub notifications are sometimes hard to fully dig through, and we wouldnât want to miss your report. Please include a description on how to reproduce the issue if possible. Our security team will get your email and will attempt to reproduce and fix the issue as soon as possible. Please note: OpenProject currently does not offer a bug bounty program. We will do our best to give you the appropriate credits for responsibly disclosing a security vulnerability to us. We will gladly reference your work, name, website on every publication we do related to the security update.
