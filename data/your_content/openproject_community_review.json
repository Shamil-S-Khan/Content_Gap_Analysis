  "content": "OpenProject is a leading free and open-source project management software designed for both traditional and agile project management methodologies. It is a web-based solution that allows teams to access project-related information from anywhere, at any time. The OpenProject Community edition is a free, open-source version that offers a comprehensive set of features, unlimited users, and projects. It is released under the GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3), emphasizing software freedom, allowing users to run, copy, distribute, study, modify, and improve the software. This edition receives regular updates and new releases, maintained by an active international community and a core developer team. Users can install and operate it on-premises, maintaining full control over their data. Overall, OpenProject receives positive community reviews, often praised for its extensive feature set, intuitive interface, and effectiveness in managing projects and teams efficiently. Users appreciate the comprehensive features supporting various project management approaches, its intuitive and easy-to-use interface, centralized communication and data, and strong focus on data security and sovereignty. The software's flexibility and customization options, along with the benefits of its open-source nature (affordability and accessibility), are highly valued. Some considerations include a slight learning curve for new users, limited technical support for the Community Edition (requiring self-hosting users to rely on community resources), and certain advanced features being exclusive to paid Enterprise editions. OpenProject fosters a global community of open-source enthusiasts, developers, and business partners. The OpenProject Foundation provides an organizational framework for technical decisions and promotes continuous development. The development roadmap and discussions are openly accessible, and the community actively contributes to its development on platforms like GitHub. Support options include online documentation, community forums, and email support for joining the community.",
