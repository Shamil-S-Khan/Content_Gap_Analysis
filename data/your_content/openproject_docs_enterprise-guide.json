Important Changes in our Enterprise plans with OpenProject 16.0.0: Starting with 16.0 (scheduled for 2025-05-21), we will be introducing new Enterprise plans that include changes to our Enterprise add-ons. There are certain add-ons that will only be available on higher plans. Customers who have booked an Enterprise plan before May 21, 2025, will not be affected by the changes. You will not lose any features with the update. The OpenProject Enterprise editions (both cloud and on-premises) include all OpenProject Community features plus, based on the selected Enterprise plan, additional Enterprise add-ons, as well as professional support. Note This guide only describes the management and administration of your Enterprise cloud and Enterprise on-premises subscriptions. The Enterprise add-on descriptions are included in the respective parts of the OpenProject User guide and System admin guide. Support Find out more about our different support options. Enterprise add-ons Preview of Enterprise plan changes (effective 2025-05-21) With the release of OpenProject 16.0.0 on May 21, 2025, we will update our Enterprise plans and with it the containing add-ons.
