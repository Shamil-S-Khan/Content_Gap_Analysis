What is the Agile methodology? Agile methodology is a project management framework that breaks projects down into several dynamic phases, commonly known as sprints. The Agile framework is an iterative methodology. After every sprint, teams reflect and look back to see if there was anything that could be improved so they can adjust their strategy for the next sprint. What is the Agile Manifesto? The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is a document that details the four values and 12 principles for Agile software development. It was published in February 2001 by 17 software developers who needed an alternative to the more linear product development process. What are the 4 pillars of Agile? As outlined in the Agile Manifesto, there are four main values of Agile project management: Individuals over processes and tools. Agile teams value team collaboration and teamwork over working independently and doing things \"by the book.” Individuals over processes and tools. Agile teams value team collaboration and teamwork over working independently and doing things \"by the book.” Working software over comprehensive documentation.

If the four values of the Agile model are the weight-bearing pillars of a house, then the 12 Agile principles are the rooms you can build within that house. These principles can be easily adapted to fit the needs of your software development process. The 12 principles used in Agile methodology are: Satisfy customers through early, continuous improvement and delivery.When customers receive new updates regularly, they're more likely to see the changes they want within the product. This leads to happier, more satisfied customers—and more recurring revenue.
