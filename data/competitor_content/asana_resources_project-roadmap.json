Project roadmap: How to create one, with examples and tips Making sure you start a project on the right foot is critical. Whether it’s a short-term campaign like planning for a virtual event or a long-term initiative like rolling out a new IT tool, communicating your high-level project overview and getting your stakeholders on the same page is a key element of launching a great project. So: how do you do it? You might start by creating a project charter or business case to get approval for your project. Once you do, you could create a project plan to provide the key blueprints for your work. Then, you can schedule a project kickoff and brainstorming session with all relevant stakeholders. Depending on the project, you might even draft a creative brief. But while these strategies can be critical elements of a project launch, a project roadmap is the best way to visualize your project schedule and align on business goals.

What is a project roadmap? A project roadmap is a high-level overview of your project deliverables, key milestones, and overall project goals. It should be the first thing you create when you start a project. With your project roadmap as a jumping-off point, you can create other important project planning documents, like a project plan and a project schedule. If you’ve never used a project roadmap, it can be a little confusing to differentiate it from other project planning elements. Here’s how they differ: Project roadmap vs. project plan Your project roadmap and your project plan have a lot in common. They should both be created at the beginning of a project, and they’re both living documents—rather than static, set-in-stone decrees. But unlike your project plan, your project roadmap should only focus on a high-level overview. Make sure you don’t get bogged down in too many specifics when you’re creating your project roadmap, since that would dilute the focus of the document. Remember: it is a bird’s-eye view, not turn-by-turn directions. To create a good project plan, you’ll want to dive into some of the details—like your project timeline, what your budget is, what each individual stakeholder’s roles are, and any success metrics you’ll be using to grade your project. Project roadmap vs product roadmap A product roadmap is your product team’s vision for the features you plan to launch in a given time period. Your product roadmap is your team’s single source of truth for these launches. It’ll typically include nuanced details like the priority or scope of the launch, any product and engineering stakeholders that are involved, and the marketing bill of materials—just to name a few. Despite the similarity in names, a project roadmap is a completely different ball game. Any project, not just a product launch project, can and should have a project roadmap. For example, you’d want to create a project roadmap for a virtual event your team is planning or an upcoming project your IT team is rolling out. In both cases, your project roadmap is the overview for your project goals and how you’re going to get there. Project roadmap vs. Gantt chart A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project. It looks like a timeline and uses a horizontal bar chart to represent tasks and deliverables. Oftentimes, teams choose to build their project roadmaps in timeline view Gantt charts, and they use the horizontal bar chart component within the Gantt chart to represent high-level initiatives over time. However, Gantt charts have a lot of functionality outside of project roadmaps. Gantt charts make it easy to visualize the relationships and dependencies between tasks. They also provide at-a-glance insight into how the pieces of your project fit together and any important milestones coming up. Even if you plan to build your project roadmap as a Gantt chart, make sure you’re choosing a tool that offers various ways to visualize work and the ability to easily switch between visualizations—not just as a timeline, but also as a Kanban board, to-do list, and calendar. That way, not only will you be able to create an effective project roadmap, but your stakeholders will also be able to view the work in whatever view works best for them. Why you need a project roadmap If you’ve never created a project roadmap before, you might be asking: Is this really necessary? And while every project doesn’t need a project roadmap (more on that later), if your work is time-bound, a project roadmap is the best way to communicate your high-level goals to your stakeholders. There are three main benefits to creating a project roadmap before your kickoff meeting. Once your team has mastered project-level planning, consider cr",
