A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart used to illustrate the timeline of a project and its tasks. This gives your team a visual overview of project information like your project schedule, upcoming milestones, and overall project timeline. Each horizontal bar within the chart represents a task, and the length of each bar represents the amount of time that step or task will take. When you zoom out to look at the full picture, these charts give project managers and project teams an overview of what work needs to get done, who’s doing it, and when. Gantt charts typically include the following components: Tasks Tasks Task start date Task start date Task duration Task duration Task end date Task end date Task owner Task owner Milestones Milestones Most Gantt charts also offer additional context about how project tasks connect to each other, who they’re assigned to, and what important deadlines and milestones are coming up. With a dynamic timeline, team members have at-a-glance insight into what they’re responsible for and how their work impacts the project as a whole. History of the Gantt chart Polish engineer Karol Adamiecki created the first iteration of a Gantt chart in 1896, which he called the harmonogram. Adamiecki published his findings in Russian and Poli sh, which made them difficult to access in English-speaking countries. In 1910, American mechanical engineer Henry Gantt independently popularized a similar chart in the United States, which he devised in order to represent how long factory workers spent on a given task. These two systems have since been merged to create what we know today as the modern-day Gantt chart. After tracking factory employees’ tasks, these charts became a popular way to track project schedules. Originally, these charts were drawn on paper, which meant that whenever the schedule changed, the charts had to be redrawn. Later, project managers used pieces of paper or blocks to represent the task bars, so they could move them around as needed. Gantt chart example Studying this example of a Gantt chart is helpful for understanding how to map out a project lifecycle effectively. Initial steps: The project starts with the \"Identify key stakeholders\" activity, which lays the groundwork for all other tasks that follow. Initial steps: The project starts with the \"Identify key stakeholders\" activity, which lays the groundwork for all other tasks that follow. Planning phase and project launch: Tasks like \"Map out dependencies\" are scheduled alongside \"Define project goals,\" due by December 15 to indicate tasks that can occur simultaneously. While the \"Kick off project\" action establishes a key milestone and planning deadline.

Finalizing and reporting: Activities that help team members and stakeholders recognize the steps needed as the project culminates to a conclusion include \"Prepare presentation\" and \"Present to leadership.\" While the final phases of the project are represented by tasks like \"Communicate results\" and \"Complete project,\" which concentrate on project wrap-up and outcome communication.
